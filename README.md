# MakersJam Mozilla Club OnTheRoad

## *What if there was a Mozilla Club in every school?*

## *What if the Web Literacy Map was at the heart of school curriculum?*

## *What if teacher training had web literacy as a core module?*

MakersJam is a Mozilla Club committed to shaping the web through peer to peer learning, collaboration, experimentation and creation,finding new and imaginative ways to express ourselves, and having lots of fun.

## Vision
MakersJam OnTheRoad seeks to reach a wider audience by offering Maker Educator Residencies in schools and informal learning spaces, supporting them to kickstart their MakerSpaces, grow professional learning opportunities and develop an experimental/tactile approach to hands on learning of Web Literacy skills.
MakersJam aims to make web literacy an embedded part of primary/elementary school curriculum and teacher/educator training..

## Getting Started

Welcome to MakersJam Mozilla Club OnTheRoad project. The project welcomes educators, tinkerers, librarians, museum educators, artists, designers, coders, Mozilla club leaders/participants and  parents. 
Mozilla Club Switzerland started in January 2016. After over a year of successful experimentation and trying to capture the spirit of MozFest, MakersJam is heading out on the road. Check out our story here at <a href="https://learningfreewheel.wordpress.com/">the learningfreewheel blog</a>.
Our club members captured the essence of the club:

<b>MakersJam </b>
<i>"Mix things up that people don't normally go together to create something amazing 
that people don't normally associate together."</i>

<b>The Jam</b>
<i>"The freedom to play whatever you feel like playing by listening to others"</i>

## Contributing
People from all backgrounds can contribute to this project. You might enjoy participating if you:
  * Love to tinker.
  * Love to connect seemingly random ideas.
  * Love to teach.
  * Love to learn visually or in a tactile way.
  * Love to code.
  * Love the MozFest experience.

There are lots of ways to contribute to this project that use different skills and talents. For example, you could:
    
    
   * Invent different models and projects that would take the MakersMam into schools.
   
   * Try different tactile approaches and think of how to map them the web literacy map.
    
   * Help create a repository of open and shareable resources that would be useful to others with little to no coding background looking to create a MakerSpace and embed web literacy in their classroom.
    
   * Write lesson plans, facilitation guides or recipes for the classroom or informal learning spaces.
    
   * Sequence Web Literacy lessons with other subject areas (i.e. XRay Goggles in Language Arts)
    
   * Create online text or video explainers and tutorials about MakersJam.
