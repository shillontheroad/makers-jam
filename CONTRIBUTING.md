# Contributing to MakersJam OnTheRoad

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MakersJam on the road :tada:! 
This document provides a set of guidelines for contributing to MakersJam on GitHub. These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved, to understand the vision and how you can support the project.
To get started I have created a central idea with four lines of inquiry. To develop these lines of inquiry there is a series of essential questions detailed.
# Project vision.
MakersJam OnTheRoad seeks to reach a wider audience by offering Maker Residencies in schools and informal learning spaces, supporting them to kickstart their MakerSpaces, grow professional learning opportunities and develop an experimental/tactile approach to hands on learning of Web Literacy skills.
MakersJam aims to make web literacy an embedded part of primary/elementary school curriculum and teacher/educator training.
# Central Idea
Developing Web Literacy skills is central to primary/elementary school curriculum
